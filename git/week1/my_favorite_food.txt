Macaroni (Persian Spaghetti)

Ingredients
 400 Grams spaghetti noodles
 1 Pound ground beef
 1 medium onion, diced
 ½ bell pepper, diced
 6 white button mushrooms, sliced
 4 Tablespoons tomato paste *or 1 cup of tomato sauce
 2 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced
 1 Teaspoon turmeric
 ½ Teaspoons black pepper
 ½ Teaspoons oregano *optional
 1 Teaspoon salt (for spaghetti)
 1 Teaspoon salt (for meat sauce)
  water
  vegetable oil
Instructions
In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion to the pan and saute until soft.


Mix in diced bell pepper and saute until tender.


Add ground beef and stir until well mixed and brown.


Add turmeric, salt, oregano and black pepper to the mixture and stir until well mixed.


Add sliced mushrooms to the mixture. Saute for about five minutes until soft.


Add tomato paste and stir for 1-2 minutes. When you notice the color of the paste changing (to a red-orange color), it is done.


Add 1/3 cup of water, lower the heat and let cook until water is evaporated.


In the meantime, in a large pot bring water to a boil and add salt to it. Cook spaghetti 2-3 minutes less than the time suggested on its package instructions, strain and set aside.


In a sauce pan (big enough to fit pasta/sauce), heat 2 tablespoon oil on medium heat. Add 1 layer of sliced potatoes to cover the bottom of the pan.


Add a bit of pasta on potatoes and then a layer of the meat sauce. Keep layering until you've used all of the pasta and sauce.


Decrease heat to low, cover the lid and cook for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, stir the spaghetti and serve. Don't forget to scrape the potatoes from the bottom of the pan and serve beside the spaghetti.
